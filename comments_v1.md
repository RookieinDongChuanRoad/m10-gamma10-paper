Dear Rongfu,

I read the draft of the paper that you sent me last Wednesday.
Here are some general comments:

- The statements that you make have to be more precise. Every single sentence that you write in a paper has the potential to raise a question in the reader’s mind. If so, there has to be an answer, preferably in the following sentence. Otherwise the reader will lose trust in what he or she is reading. Example: in the Introduction you write "Numerous works in literature have confirmed that the dissipationless dry mergers is the major mechanism that attribute to that rapid size growth”. This is a very strong statement: “confirmed” means that there is absolutely no doubt that this is the case. But in the case of the size growth, we are still not 100% sure about what the main mechanism is. So it’s better to modify that sentence to say it in a more conservative way: for example by using “suggested” instead of “confirmed”. Other example: “or the number of mergers will be too large”. What does that mean? Too large for what? Third example: "These fresh blood of quiescent population are relatively larger”. How do we know that? We don’t really know what happens to a galaxy when it quenches. It could be that it becomes more compact (some models predict that).

- The writing must follow a logical flow. Each statement has to be logically connected to the rest of the paper. When writing about something that you’ve worked on for a long time, it is very easy to take for granted some of these connections. So you have to put yourself in the shoes of the reader, trying to anticipate what questions he or she might have. Example: "purely minor merger is not sufficient to explain the entire growth”. This is the first time that you mention minor mergers. Why should we care if minor mergers are not sufficient? Why cannot galaxies grow by major mergers instead?

- It’s unclear what is the question that we’re trying to answer with this study. This is probably also my fault for not explaining things too well. But at this point you should have an idea of what are the open questions regarding the evolution of massive quiescent galaxies. Then you should tell the reader about these open questions, otherwise why should one read this paper?

- Before you say what you did, you need first to explain why you did it. Example: in Section 2 you start off by saying where you got the data from. But first you need to explain what you need exactly. What kind of galaxies? How do you plan to select them? What measurements you need for each galaxy? How do you plan on obtaining those measurements? After you’ve explained that, then you can say that you took spectra from GAMA and photometry from KiDS. Other example: “we exclude galaxies that are not overlapped with KiDS, in order to utilize the measurement of structural parameters.” Why do you need structural parameters?

- You need to make more references to past works. For example, Damjanov et al. (2019), van Dokkum et al. (2010), Hilz et al. (2013): what did they find? What are we learning new with respect to them?

- One thing that is missing is a quantitative comparison between the observations and the simulation. You do write that if every galaxy experienced a xi=0.2 merger, then the M*10-Gamma*10 relation would evolve, but by how much? Could it be that the evolution would be within the error bars of your measurements? And what is the stellar mass growth rate of a galaxy that has a xi=0.2 merger between z=0.4 and z=0.15? Is that reasonable? If not, can you rescale the growth rate to something more reasonable (according, for example, to a model like the one by Moster et al.)?

- What did we learn from this experiment?



These were the most important things. Now some more minor comments:

- Why do you show the expression for the size growth from Naab et al. (2009) in the introduction? If we’re not using it again, it might only confuse the reader. Sometimes it’s better to write less, so that you can get to the main point of the paper more quickly.

- Section 2.1: “I use” -> “we use”

- Section 3.2. The explanation of how you measured M*10 should go in Section 2, not here.

- Section 4.2. The first two paragraphs are a bit unclear. It seems like you’re using a lot of words to say that we could also use photometric redshifts.

- Section 5. The second bullet point is obvious.

- Section 5. No need to repeat details of the analysis here. Just mention the main results.
