## 1 What do we know?
The existence of the dramatic size growth of ETGs. Mergers, especially minor merger could be possible mechanism of such growth. 
## 2 What do we not know?
Our understanding on the details of the growth of ETGs could be improved, as there are still some issue of minor merger scenario. We are also not clear about the evolution of inner density profile.
